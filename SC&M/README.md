Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SC&M) demo

This folder contains a client-side page module that mirrors the "Library of Congresses" analytics page but for Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SC&M). It renders KPIs, filters, charts, a world map, a detailed table, and CSV export.

How to use

- Load `SC&M/renderSCM.js` from `index.html` or dynamically when routing to `scm`.
- The module exposes `window.externalRenderSCM` and will register itself to the global `ROUTES` under id `scm` if `window.ROUTES` exists.
SC&M module removed per undo request. Original files were deleted to revert the change.
